### - <span class="color-red">Casting</span> :
 **Casting** in C is explicitly converting a value from one data type to another.
 \- <span class="color-yellow">implicit caste</span> → done _automatically_ by the compiler 
 (e.g., `int x = 5; float y = x;`)
 \- <span class="color-yellow">explicite caste</span>→ done _manually_ by the programmer using parentheses (e.g., `float y = (float)x;`)
