 - The fixe size of the array, you can't increase or add an element to the array if it is full, you should reallocate an other array and move all element to the new array 
 
 - *A*nd when you want to add an element to a specific index also you need to move all the array element where this take more time and more resources like cpu and RAM.
 
 - **An array requires a contiguous block of memory, This means:** The memory addresses allocated for the array must be sequential, one right after the other.
 
 - If the available free memory is fragmented (scattered in small, non-adjacent blocks), you cannot create the array—even if the total free memory is technically large enough.
